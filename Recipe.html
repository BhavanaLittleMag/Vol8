<h5>Gur Amra </h5>
<p>
In West Bengal, Gur Aam (mango cooked in jaggery with spices) is a delicacy. 
  Made with green, raw mangoes, bottled, and left to dry in the sun during the summer months, 
  this delicacy invariably tempts little boys, particularly those looking for trouble 
  during the long hot afternoons. Many a story has been told of broken pickle bottles 
  and repurcussions thereafter.

During the monsoon months (July - August), Amra (Spondias mombin) or Hog Plum - 
  the sour tangy cousin of mango is plentiful. A native to the tropical Americas
  (including the West Indies), the tree was introduced by the Portuguese in South
  Asia in the beginning of the 17th century.

My delight knew no bounds when I found a middle-aged woman standing under an 
  umbrella in the pouring rain at a local market, selling fresh hog plums from her garden. 
  She had come down all the way from Tiluri, a rural town in Bankura to my hometown
  of Asansol (specifically to the Burnpur vegetable market) to sell these delicacies! 
  I thought she would charge me a fortune for them - but lo and behold! 
  She simply told me they would be ten rupees -- these days even bus 
  fares are more than that in metropolitan cities.

Armed with this tangy cousin of the mango, I decided to pickle it with jaggery.

<h5>Recipe for Gur Amra</h5> 
=========================== 
1. Slice the amra (horizontally or vertically - based on your preference), after gently removing the stem at the top. 
If it is hard to cut, use a knife with a bigger blade or extra force as appropriate.
2. Add turmeric and salt to taste. Spread them out on a flat surface
  (such as a plate or jhuri (basket made with bamboo)) and leave them in bright sunlight for 3-4 hours. 
3. Heat mustard oil (vegetable or soybean oil can also be used if preferred) in a wok. 
  Splutter panch phoron (mixture of anise (jeera), coriander, methi, sauf, and nigella seeds) and a few red chilies.
  I also added some curry leaves growing in our garden!
4. Add in the amra, adjusting the levels of turmeric, chili, and salt as required. 
  Add bhaja masala (dry roasted jeera, finely ground) and crushed jaggery so that it coats the amra. 
  Let the jaggery start to melt, but be extra careful not to let it burn. 
5. Keep stirring continuously until it becomes a thick paste. Let it cool, bottle it, and set it out in the sun for longevity.
