The Man, the cat, and the cube <br> <br> 

by Karubaki Goswami <br><br>

He walks. <br><br>

Listen. The footsteps are getting closer and closer. <br><br>

It's night-time now in sector 16, and he walks in the same manner he walked yesterday, the day before, and the day before. <br>
The footsteps are getting closer. He drags the sole on the pebble-clad ground, a scratching sound. His left leg is damaged. <br><br>

Injury? No. From birth? Likely. <br><br>

He huffs to the tune of an old song. Can you hear it? No. Nobody can. His words are too mumbled. He's old. <br><br>

He just crossed the road. He has a beard - the cut yet ruffled kind you could see thousands of years back on the face of the cowbacks. <br>
He's coming this way, past the identical yellow buildings and the artificial moss walls. He stops. He's looking at the traffic lights. <br>

What is he looking at? The lights? It's green. No. He's looking at the box where the human police used to sit a long time ago. <br>
Is someone sitting? No. He's looking at the Cyan cube. <br><br>

He hates it. <br><br>

He loves it, though. <br><br>

Maybe both. <br><br>

He halts again, in the middle of the crossing. The sound of crying. A stray cat? <br>
In this day and age? Yes. Will he hand it over, you think? <br><br>

No. He will not. Look, he pets the cat, murmurs something, and does something to its leg. <br><br>

He dislocated it. <br><br>

No, it's leg was already dislocated. He fixed it. A doctor? No, his movements were too sloppy. A scientist? <br>
Too broad of a department, but maybe. <br><br>

The cat has stopped crying. It's far too clever to keep on crying now that it has been fixed. <br>
It won't scream anymore. They'll get hold of it if they know about it. <br><br>

You were right, he is a scientist. Or a mathematician, perhaps? He is reciting Pi while he takes the cat inside his coat... <br><br>

Smart. <br><br>

But his dress is not smart. It's quite ugly. His blue trousers are too long and baggy, brown from the dust of the road <br>
folding around his ankles. He wears a long coat - quite old old-fashioned man, isn't he? <br><br>

Look, he's walking again, the small cat peeking from inside his pockets. <br><br>

He crosses the blue buildings now - he lives in the only lime building at the edge of sector 16. <br>
He takes a turn, stopping here and there to peek through the curtains of the windows of the other buildings. <br>
He stands on the sidewalk, looking through the window glass when the curtain moves, and sees the screens on the walls. <br><br>

He watches the advanced Cyan Cube advertisement thrice, the cat purring at the blue light the screens emit. <br><br>

The cat scratches him through his grey-white beard. He tuts. <br><br>

He walks again. The night is almost over, and so is his walk. <br>
He will get noticed by the workers if he doesn't hurry up, and he hates that. <br><br>

He hates talking to mindless humans. <br>

He's walking. One, two, and three steps, five to go to reach his lime-coloured door. <br><br>

He stops. A screeching siren. <br><br>

The patrol? Obviously. <br><br>

One man bends down the elevating vehicle. 'Patrol 9, Freeze!' <br><br>

He doesn't move. <br><br>

'Person number?' <br><br>

'1137.' <br><br>

'So the last member of the sector?' <br><br>

'.....' <br><br>

'What were you doing at this time?' <br><br>

'Walking.' <br><br>

'Walking.' <br><br>

'Yes.' <br><br>

'Just.... walking. Why?' <br><br>

'No reason.' <br><br>

'Why?' <br><br>

'I like the fresh air.' <br><br>

'You can get fresh air at your home if you apply for it at the headquarters. Supply has been opened for generals.' <br><br>

'I don't like artificially created air.' <br><br>
 
'It's fresh.' <br><br>

'It's fake.' <br><br>

'Okay. Are you on any medicines? Pills or-' <br><br>

'None.' <br><br>

'What century is this?' <br><br>

'23rd.' <br><br>

'What do we say in greeting here on Earth?' <br><br>

'Hope your life is beautiful.' <br><br>

'Same to you, and- what is that?'   <br><br>
 
It's the cat. It is peeking out from the curtain of the coat, nibbling the cloth. <br><br>

'Its a...robot. My robot.' <br><br>

'No it's not- is that, is that real?' <br><br>

'No it's not. It's just.... expensive. Realistic.' <br><br>

The cat meowed. <br><br>

'Alright. Wonderful conduct of a general - lying to the patrol. Get in the vehicle, please - we need to see if you're intoxicated -' <br><br>

'Why would I need to- I'm not bothering anybody!' <br><br>

'You are holding a live animal which is a federal offense, Sir, give me your thumbprint and the cat, no harm shall be ... <br><br>

'You'll kill it if I give you the cat to extract the bloody DNA for your stupid experiments-' <br><br>

'Come with us.' <br><br>

'I'm busy!' <br><br>

'Being a menace to society? Yes, I got that, sir, now please press your thumb on the Cube -' <br><br>

'I'm not bothering anybody- No, I'll not be touching that-' <br><br>

'You were walking at a time assigned for sleep, sir. What is wrong, man- it's a Cyan Cube, everybody knows a cyan cu-' <br><br>

'I told you I wouldn't let me go- did you just laser-tie me, young man-' <br><br>

'Just give me the thumb print, Cyan- activate thumb print -' <br><br>

'Cyan, deactivate.' <br><br>

The officer halted. He looked back at his comrades, barely managing to stop his laugh. <br>
A mere general occupant has tried to deactivate the Cyan Cube, and of course it wouldn't <br>
listen to anybody who's not from the headquarters - <br><br>

'Deactivated Thumb Print. Hello, Doctor L.' <br><br>

The man shot the cube a glare. 'Take off with your minions right now.' <br><br>

'Yes, Dr. L.' <br><br>

The vehicle disappeared with the patrol. <br><br>

The man sighed, and pinched his nose bridge, his awfully old steel spectacle frame going upwards. <br><br>

Who is he, I wonder? <br><br>

He gets in his house- all odd looking with a thing called papers- papers sewn up together covered in hardboard- books, <br>
yes, rather odd things. <br><br>

He drinks the water from the allotted pipe in the kitchen filled with his own-grown mushrooms. <br>

The cat hops on the kitchen island and stretches. <br>

................. <br><br>

At the Head Quarters. <br><br>

'Why did you go there? Oh, god, these new employees!' <br><br>

'Hold on, how would I even know he was the one who made the code for Cyan Cube?' <br><br>

'Sector 16 was off-limits- it's for the kind who can't do anything with the techs and all-' <br><br>

'But he deactivated Cyan.' <br><br>

'..... That's because he made it, genius. He stays there of his own accord - for his 'own peace' . <br>
Cyan doesn't need its master's voice to be installed on every update - it just needs it when it was initiated.' <br><br>

'He didn't even touch the cube- it was a harmless AI-' <br><br>

'He hates it.' <br><br>

'What?' <br><br>

'What?' <br><br>

'He made it.' <br><br>

'It took his job.' <br><br>

'He made it so it could take his job- that's why Cyan is self-updating.' <br><br>

'Well.' <br><br>

'What?' <br><br>

'He didn't know how much he could do until he did it.' <br><br>

'So now he walks around like a Ghost at midnight? Sniffing for air?' <br><br>

'He has the level 1 DNA. He has his....quirks.' <br><br>

'No way, he wasn't checked and altered like us at birth?' <br><br>

'Yeah, and that's why he made the cube and we're following the cube.' <br><br>

'So if he made the cube - he also made the tech for extracting the DNAs and made healthier hybrids-' <br><br>

'Yeah.' <br><br>

'Oh.' <br><br>

'Hmm.' <br><br>

'He's getting out of the house again today- look at the screen.' <br><br>

'Hmm.' <br><br>

He walks. <br><br>
