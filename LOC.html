<h4>A Trip to the Library Of Congress (LOC)</h4>
by Agneya Dutta Pooleery <br>
=============================<br>
I needed to go to the <a href="https://www.loc.gov/">Library Of Congress (LOC)</a> to research a project I was working on about the New York Tea Party. <br>
This event was an integral part of the American Revolution and occurred around the time of the Boston Tea Party, only a year later. <br>
These tea parties were designed to retaliate against the unfair taxes imposed by the British monarchy on the Colonies<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>. 
<br><br>

In the 1750’s, the Colonies prospered because they were able to sell goods to the British army. <br>
In the 1760s however, the Seven Years’ War<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> moved into the Caribbean and the Colonies had a lot of surplus goods. <br>
In order to repay their debt from the Seven Years’ War, Britain decided to tax the Colonies. <br>
They viewed it as very necessary in order to provide quarters for the soldiers and to protect the Colonies from the French and other enemies of the Crown. <br>
This debt led to a long series of taxes, some of which were: the Sugar Act (1764), Stamp Act (1765), and Townshend Acts (1767). With each new act, repeal, and new act, <br>
the Colonies grew angrier. Eventually, violent protests broke out, one being the New York Tea Party. <br><br>

I wanted to find some resources about this incident including, political cartoons, newspapers on the event, images, and books from the Library Of Congress. <br><br>

Me and my dad made the trip to the LOC in Washington, D.C. From our home in Ewing, New Jersey, we made our way over to Trenton station to catch an Amtrak. <br>
We were late and barely made it. The train stopped at Philadelphia, Wilmington in Delaware, and some other stations, 
before eventually arriving at the Union Station in Washington, D.C. <br>
It was surprisingly quick and we reached in a couple of hours.<br>

(Left) Union Station and (Right) The Library of Congress<br><br>

The station at Washington, D.C. was massive. It was made of marble with many statues, depicting important personalities from American history.<br> 
It also had its own food court. We had to walk down to the Library of Congress. We passed a few Senator buildings. <br>
The Senator buildings oversee the offices and commit space for the U.S. Congress. There are three main Senate buildings: Dirksen, Hart, and Russel. <br>
Then we saw the Capitol building and the Supreme Court. <br>
We took pictures at all of those places. Then, we made our way into the Jefferson Building of the Library of Congress. <br>
The Library of Congress was actually multiple buildings, not a single one. There probably was too much 
information to be contained in one building.<br><br>
	
My dad had already got us tickets beforehand. On entering, we inquired around about the location of the microfilm section and were directed <br>
to the appropriate place. We had to deposit our belongings in a room before entering the building. The LOC was very crowded. <br>
We made our way to a reading room. My dad got a reading room card - I was underage so I couldn’t get one for myself - but upon our first <br>
inquiry we got the information that this was the wrong building for searching for the kind of information I needed! <br><br>

Micro-film and containers used to store them.<br>

So, then we had to head over to the Madison building through an underground tunnel. We then headed up to the historical <br>
newspapers and articles section, where we were given a file containing a lot of the newspaper dates, and we sifted through them <br>
and found a few newspapers that were from the time period of interest. We requested a microfilm for the appropriate newspaper. <br><br>

Software used to read the historical newspaper from micro-film<br><br>

A micro-film is a tiny length of film containing micro-photographs of a newspaper, article or another document. <br>
This provides a way to preserve and store large amounts of print materials in a small space. Each page of the newspaper is copied <br>
and shrunk down to a tiny image, and the images are then printed sequentially on a reel of film. <br>
The images can later be expanded and displayed using specialized equipment, which allows users to scroll the film from page to page [1]. <br>
After waiting a bit, the microfilm eventually arrived. A librarian showed us how to work it, and helped us find the date, and then the <br>
newspaper article that we needed. Then, we were able to take photos of it and print it for later use. <br>
This was the primary source I needed for my project and I was glad to have found this important resource for my project. <br><br>

We checked if anything else was needed, but a further search revealed there wasn’t really anything else that I <br>
could get at the LOC. So, we exited and got lunch at Union Station. I was surprised to see that the Library of <br>
Congress contained so much information - it needed three buildings to contain <br>
all the records! It was also amazing to learn that they have some records dating back to the very <br>
founding of the Colonies. It was different from my local library in Williamsville, NY - the Audubon Library - because <br>
it had a lot of variety of material, much much more than just books. <br>
It would be certainly interesting if I had to visit again for research, <br>
because I know now that whatever I need, I can most certainly find it in the Library of Congress! <br>
