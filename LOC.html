<h4>A Trip to the Library Of Congress (LOC)</h4>

=============================<br>
I needed to go to the Library Of Congress (LOC) to research a project I was working on about the New York Tea Party. 
This event was an integral part of the American Revolution and occurred around the time of the Boston Tea Party, only a year  later. 
These tea parties were designed to retaliate the unfair taxes imposed by the British monarchy on the Colonies. 
Originally, the United States was a group of Colonies on the east side of America. 
The thirteen colonies were New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, 
Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Georgia, Delaware, South Carolina, and New Hampshire.

In the 1750’s, the Colonies prospered because they were able to sell goods to the British army. 
In the 1760s however, the Seven Years’ War moved into the Caribbean and the Colonies had a lot of surplus goods. 
The Seven Years’ War was a war between France and Great Britain over North American land claims, around the area of Pittsburg, Pennsylvania. 
In order to repay their debt from the Seven Years’ War, Britain decided to tax the Colonies. 
They viewed it as very necessary in order to provide quarters for the soldiers and to protect the Colonies from the French and other enemies of the Crown. 
This debt led to a long series of taxes, some of which were: the Sugar Act (1764), Stamp Act (1765), and Townshend Acts (1767). With each new act, repeal, and new act, 
the Colonies grew angrier. Eventually, violent protests broke out, one being the New York Tea Party. 

I wanted to find some resources about this incident including, political cartoons, newspapers on the event, images and books from the Library Of Congress. 

Me and my dad made the trip to the LOC in Washington, D.C. From our home in Ewing, New Jersey, we made our way over to Trenton station to catch an Amtrak. 
We were late and barely made it. It stopped at Philadelphia, Wilmington in Delaware and some other stations, before eventually arriving at the Union Station in Washington, D.C. 
The train was surprisingly quick and we reached in a couple of hours.
The station at Washington, D.C was massive. It was made of marble with many statues, depicting important personalities from American history. 
It also had its own food court. We had to walk down to the Library of Congress. We passed a few Senator buildings and then saw the Capitol building and the Supreme Court. 
We took pictures at both of those places. Then, we made our way into the Jefferson building of the Library of Congress. 
The Library of Congress was actually multiple buildings, not a single one. There probably was too much information to be contained in one building.
	
My dad had already got us tickets beforehand. On entering, we inquired around about the location of the microfilm section and were directed 
to the appropriate place. We had to deposit our belongings in a room before entering the building. The LOC was very crowded. 
We made our way to a reading room. My dad got a reading room card - I was underage so I couldn’t get one for myself - but upon our first 
inquiry we got the information that this was the wrong building for searching for the kind of information I needed!

So, then we had to head over to the Madison building through an underground tunnel. We then headed up to the historical 
newspapers and articles section, where we were given a file containing a lot of the newspaper dates, and we sifted through them 
and found a few newspapers that were from the time period of interest. We requested a microfilm for the appropriate newspaper. 

A microfilm is a tiny length of film containing microphotographs of a newspaper, article or another document. 
This provides a way to preserve and store large amounts of print materials in a small space. Each page of the newspaper is copied 
and shrunk down to a tiny image, and the images are then printed sequentially on a reel of film. 
The images can later be expanded and displayed using specialized equipment, which allow users to scroll the film from page to page [1]. 
After waiting a bit, the microfilm eventually arrived. A librarian showed us how to work it, and helped us find the date and then the 
newspaper article that we needed. Then, we were able to take photos of it and print it for later use. 
This was the primary source I needed for my project and I was glad to have found this important resource for my project.
