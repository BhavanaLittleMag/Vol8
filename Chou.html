Asura Mask - Chhau Dance, Watercolor on mount board with paper decorations, Haimonti Dutta <br>

The Chhau dance of eastern India (Purulia, Mayurbhanj and Seraikella) is an ancient, <br>
indigenous art form combining dance and martial arts often accompanied by drums, folk music <br>
including reed pipes (mohuri) and shehnai. This dance form has been <br>
declared an intangible cultural heritage by UNESCO and is particularly attractive for its use <br>
of elaborate masks depicting characters from epics such as the Mahabharat and Ramayana.<br>
 
In the above mask re-creation, Asura -- the demon god, is studied, and some aspects of an <br>
ornamental art form - alpona are thrown in, to add vivacity.
